# Breast-cancer-survival-prediction-model
This project is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the survival likelihood of breast cancer patients. Using patient data such as demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment details, the model analyzes patterns to provide insights into survival outcomes.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and encodes categorical features.
Machine Learning Models: Implements algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Model Evaluation: Includes performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curves.
Interactive Interface: Offers a user-friendly interface for clinicians or researchers to input patient data and get predictions.
Visualization Tools: Provides graphs and charts for feature importance and survival probability trends.
Use Cases:
Assist healthcare professionals in treatment planning.
Aid researchers in understanding survival patterns and risk factors.
Educate the public about factors affecting breast cancer survival.
